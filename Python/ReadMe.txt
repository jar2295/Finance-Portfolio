This application allows users to input their preferred weights for various financial ratios, specifying whether they want each ratio to be maximized or minimized. It then retrieves an up-to-date list of S&P 500 index companies and scrapes the necessary data for each ticker. Each company is individually ranked based on each metric, and using the user-defined weights, the app calculates a composite score to rank the companies from best to worst. Users can also download the data in Excel format for further analysis. This app provides a quick overview of S&P 500 companies, serving as a starting point for identifying potentially undervalued or overvalued stocks for more detailed examination.

More Updates I need to consider
1)The App might take a bit to load when opening --> need to work on efficiencies in the code
2)Potentially add other index's
3)Add more ratios
